      "   Generated Review: It's got a lot going for it. It's not at all interesting. The story is, in my opinion, very predictable. The acting is simply awful. The dialog is unbelievable. The characters are so over the top, it's laughable. I mean, what's up with the name of the character? It's so bad, I can't even begin to describe how bad it is. I'm not a big fan of the \"heroes\" in this movie, but there were enough bad dialogs and dialogs in this movie to make me laugh. I don't know why, but when someone writes a comment on this movie, they're usually talking about a plot that is obviously not going anywhere, and yet the writer is so incredibly lazy, you can't even believe it. The only thing that makes me laugh is when one of the characters says, \"The greatest role ever played!\" I'm not joking\n",

If that is how it was originally told the script must have been interesting to begin with.The filmmakers tried to show vampires in a sexual way to help keep your fascination at bay. If people liked Vampire:Bloodbath they made the plot line that a bed-fed rat will torture someone for a good time, so there could also be someone torturing everyone but her. A great choice! But vampires actually play more important roles than their prey or victims. It can be hard to tell whether the film is a horror movie or\n",

She asks him how he got to the cabin and he explains that he was hitchhiking and the guy he was with left him. The woman explains that she was hitchhiking as well and that she was picked up by the same guy that picked up the young man. The woman then explains that she is the girl in the accident and the young man is her boyfriend.

      "   Generated Review: The 1975 film The Raiders (Rånarna) is a Swedish film about a gang of bank robbers who get away with their latest heist, but their luck runs out when they try to rob a bank in the small town of Kågeröd. The Raiders is a pretty standard gangster film in the same vein as the 1974 film Dog Day Afternoon, which is probably the film's main inspiration. The Raiders has all the right ingredients: a plot that builds slowly, an unlucky protagonist, and a surprisingly high body count. The film has a lot of atmosphere, but the characters are not very interesting, and the ending is not that original. Overall, The Raiders is a decent gangster film, but it could have been much better. 6/10. (DVD) <\n",

I was thinking \"A film that will last about 2 hours and be funny in parts\". And that's exactly what I got.<br /><br />It's a very funny film. It's about a bunch of superheroes who don't have much to do with each other. The best one is the Shoveller, who has the ability to throw any object (including people) that he can see. The film is very silly, with lots of great lines. The acting is good too, even though they're only playing superheroes.<br /><br />This film is great. It's very funny and it's a great watch.

But the difference between the two is vast. Romero made the best zombie movies of all time while this is one of the worst. I rented this because I saw the cover and the title and thought it was a parody of the genre. It is not. It's one of the few zombie films that make you wonder if they really meant it as a parody. Avoid this film at all costs. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is awful, and the plot is so bad it's unbelievable. The only redeeming factor is the fact that it's short, only an hour and a half.

I am therefore in no position to make a judgment about the quality of the film itself. What I can do, however, is comment on the DVD. The DVD was sent to me in a plain white envelope with no indication of the company or film on it. The DVD itself was in a paper case with a cardboard sleeve. The DVD was not region coded and had subtitles on it. The picture quality was good, but the sound was not. The DVD had no extras.

It makes such an important point about love being the essence of life; that even in horrific times when it gets all so black, true Love makes life worthwhile.

Instead of the characters developing and feeling connected, there is little or no reason to like any of the characters or even care what happens to them.<br /><br />The film itself was a very muddy print and at the time my friends and I discussed how the cinematography, which should have been a strength of the film, seemed to distract the viewer.

But I've got to get my head out of the sand and realize that their reality is different. Their culture doesn't accept certain concepts my generation takes for granted. I'm glad I have such a connection to where I come from. (The film was shown at NYU Asian American Festival, March 2005) I was surprised that the cinematography was so realistic.
